# ShadowTraffic 

## Overview

ShadowTraffic is a bash script that simulates web traffic by visiting random popular websites ([Kikobeats/top-sites](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kikobeats/top-sites/master/top-sites.json)) with randomized user-agents ([microlinkhq/top-user-agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microlinkhq/top-user-agents/refs/heads/master/src/index.json)), common headers and random delays. It's useful for mask users online activity by creating fake traffic, making it harder to track real behaviors, collect personal data, or target ads. It helps protect privacy and reduce online profiling.

## Features

- **Confuses trackers**: If someone is trying to watch your browsing habits, they will see a mess of random traffic instead of your real interests.
- **Disrupts profiling**: Advertisers won’t be able to build an accurate profile on you.
- **Masks real activity**: Your actual browsing gets hidden in the noise, making it much harder for anyone to figure out what you’re doing online.

## Requirements

- `curl`
- `jq`
